# mangascraper
this is a simple powershell script that allows you to leech manga from various other leechers. currently supported are: 
    Mangasee
    Mangakakalot
    Manganelo
it is possible to add other sites, however the website can't have anti botting tools in place and must have the manga name (and only that) as it's url. having a ID in the url greatly increases the difficulty of targeted searches, and this script doesn't support that.

To use the script download the .ps1 file, edit the manga list in the file with the manga you want to download and edit the target directory. When copying manga titles make sure that they match the title used in the URL of the leecher sites, eg did they use the english or japanese title, and remove any punctuations( ", (), #, =)
